     <h1>BLOCK STRUCTURE </h1>
     <div class="st">
        <p>In PL/SQL, code is organized into blocks. Each block has a specific structure consisting of declarations,
         executable statements, exception handling, and other optional parts. Here's the general structure of a PL/SQL block:</p>
     </div>
     <p><i>A block is a fundamental structure used to organize code. A block consists of several sections:</i></p>
     <div class="block">
        <p><b>1.Declaration Section: </b>This section is optional and is used to declare variables, constants, cursors, and other program objects that will 
            be  used within the block. Declarations are made using the DECLARE keyword.</p>
            <pre>
                <h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
                DECLARE
                x INTEGER;
                y VARCHAR2(50);
                -- Additional declarations go here
            
            </pre>
        </div>
         <div class="block2">
            <p><b>2.Executable Section (or Main Section):</b>This section is mandatory and contains the executable statements of the PL/SQL block. </p>
            <p>It can include SQL queries, procedural statements (such as loops, conditional statements, etc.), and calls to other procedures or functions.
                 The executable section begins with the BEGIN keyword and ends with the END keyword.</p>
                <pre>
                    <h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
                    BEGIN
                    x := 10; -- Assignment statement
                    y := 'Hello, World!'; -- Assignment statement
                    -- Additional executable statements go here
                   END;
                </pre> </div>
                <div class="block">
                <p><b>3.Exception Handling Section: </b>This section is optional and is used to handle exceptions (errors) 
                    that may occur during the execution of the block. </p>
                    <p>You can specify different exception handlers to deal with specific types of errors.
                         The exception handling section begins with the EXCEPTION keyword.</p>
                        <pre>
                            <h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
                            EXCEPTION
                            WHEN others THEN
                                -- Exception handler code goes here                        
                        </pre> 
                    </div>
                         <div class="block2">
                        <p><i>Here's a simple example of a PL/SQL block demonstrating these sections:</i></p>
                        <h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
                            <pre>

                            -- Declaration Section
                            x INTEGER := 10;
                       BEGIN
                            -- Executable Section
                            IF x > 0 THEN
                                    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('x is positive.');
                            ELSE
                                    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('x is non-positive.');
                             END IF;
                       EXCEPTION
                            -- Exception Handling Section
                            WHEN others THEN
                                DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('An error occurred: ' || SQLERRM);
                       END;
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>The DECLARE section declares an integer variable x and initializes it with the value 10.</p></li>
                                <li><p>The BEGIN section contains an IF statement that checks if x is greater than 0 and prints a message accordingly.</p></li>
                                <li><p>The EXCEPTION section handles any exceptions that occur during the execution of the block, printing an error message if any exception is caught.</p></li>
