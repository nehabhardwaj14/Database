    <h1>TRIGGERS</h1>
    <div class="st">
        <p>In PL/SQL, triggers are special types of stored programs that are automatically executed or fired when certain events occur on a table, 
            such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations. These triggers can be defined to execute either before or after the triggering event, 
            and they allow you to enforce complex business rules, maintain data integrity, and automate certain tasks within the database.</p>

            <h3>SYNTAX:</h3>
            CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
            {BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | {DDL_event}}

    <h2>TYPES OF TRIGGERS</h2>
    <h3>1. Before Triggers:</h3>
    <div class="st">
      <ul>
        <li><p>These triggers execute before the triggering event,
             allowing you to validate data or perform certain actions before the data modification takes place.</p></li>
             <li><p>They are commonly used for data validation and enforcement of business rules.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>2. After Triggers:</h3>
    <div class="st">
        <ul>
            <li><p>These triggers execute after the triggering event has occurred.</p></li>
            <li><p>They are often used for logging changes, updating related tables, 
                or enforcing referential integrity after the data modification has taken place.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>3. Row-Level Triggers:</h3>
    <div class="intro">
        <ul>
            <li><p>Row-level triggers fire once for each row affected by the triggering event.</p></li>
            <li><p>They have access to both the old and new values of the affected row(s), allowing for more granular control over the trigger logic.</p></li>
            <li><p>Commonly used for auditing changes or enforcing complex row-level constraints.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>4. Statement-Level Triggers:</h3>
    <div class="intro">
        <ul>
            <li><p>Statement-level triggers fire once for each triggering event, regardless of the number of rows affected.</p></li>
            <li><p>They do not have access to individual row values and are typically used for tasks that do not depend on specific row data.</p></li>
            <li><p>Often used for tasks such as logging high-level database operations or enforcing constraints that apply to the entire statement.</p></li>
        </ul>
