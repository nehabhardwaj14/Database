        <p>PL/SQL, or Procedural Language/Structured Query Language, is Oracle Corporation's procedural language extension for SQL.</p>
        <p>It allows users to combine SQL statements with procedural constructs like loops, conditions, and variables.</p>
        <p>his makes it possible to create more complex and powerful database programs and applications.

            In PL/SQL, you can define blocks of code that can be executed together. </p>
            <p>These blocks can include declarations, procedural statements, SQL queries, and exception handling. </p>
            <p>PL/SQL is often used for tasks such as writing stored procedures, functions, triggers, and packages within Oracle databases.</p>

            <p><i>Here's a simple example of a PL/SQL block that calculates the factorial of a number:</i></p>
            <pre>
                <h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
            DECLARE
            num INTEGER := 5;
            factorial INTEGER := 1;
            BEGIN
            FOR i IN 1..num LOOP
               factorial := factorial * i;
            END LOOP;
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Factorial of ' || num || ' is ' || factorial);
            END;
            </pre>
        </div>
            <div class="intro">
           <p>This block declares a variable num and initializes it to 5.</p>
             <p>It then calculates the factorial of num using a loop and prints the result using the DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE procedure.</p>

           <p> PL/SQL is a powerful tool for building robust database applications, as it allows for complex business logic to be encapsulated
             within the database itself, improving performance, security, and maintainability.</p>
