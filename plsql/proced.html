    <h1> PLSQL PROCEDURES</h1>
    <h2>NAMED PROCEDURE</h2>
    <div class="st">
        <p>In PL/SQL, a named procedure is a specific type of procedure that has a unique name and is stored in the database schema.
             Named procedures can be invoked by name from other PL/SQL blocks, SQL statements, or external applications.
             They are commonly used to encapsulate and execute a series of SQL and PL/SQL statements to perform a specific task or set of tasks.</p>

            <h3>SYNTAX:</h3>
            CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE procedure_name
            [(parameter_name [IN | OUT | IN OUT] parameter_type [, ...])]
        IS

    <h2>STORED PROCEDURE</h2>
    <div class="st">
        <p>A stored procedure is a named PL/SQL block stored in the database schema, which can be called and executed repeatedly by various
             applications or users. Stored procedures encapsulate one or more SQL and PL/SQL statements to perform a specific task or set of tasks.
              They offer several advantages, including improved performance, code reuse, security, and modularization of code.</p>
