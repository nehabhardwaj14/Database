     <h1>TRANSACTION CONTROL COMMANDS</h1>
     <div class="intro">
     <ul>
        <li><p>Commit and rollback are the transaction control commands in SQL</p></li>
        <li><p>All the commands that are executed consecutively, treated as a single unit of work and termed as a transaction.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you want to save all the commands which are executed in a transaction, then just after completing the transaction, 
            you have to execute the commit command. This command will save all the commands which are executed on a table.
             All these changes made to the table will be saved to the disk permanently.</p></li>
        <li><p>Whenever the commit command is executed in SQL, all the updations which we have carried on the table will be uploaded to the server,
             and hence our work will be saved.</p></li>
        <li><p>The rollback command is used to get back to the previous permanent status of the table, which is saved by the commit command.</p></li>
        
     </ul>

        <h3>SYNTAX:</h3>
        1.    COMMIT;
         
         <i>This statement permanently saves the changes made during the current transaction.
         Once committed, the changes become visible to other database sessions.</i>

        2.    ROLLBACK;
          
        <i>This statement rolls back (undoes) any changes made during the current transaction. 
        It effectively cancels the transaction and restores the database to its state before the transaction began.</i>
